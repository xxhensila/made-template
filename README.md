Due to the increased prices in these latest years, the U.S. households are facing difficulties in maintaining a good quality of life. An increase of living expenses could possibly affect people in various forms, considering **diminished housing affordability**. In this regard, this is a sensitive topic that needs to be addressed; furthermore, it needs to be analyzed if the latest living costs of U.S. residents are affecting the people‚Äôs ability to afford a place. To investigate this, this project aims to answer the question:

#### **How do essential living expenses impact housing affordability for households across the U.S.?**

## Features
1. Insights into essential costs of living and the correlation with households' incomes in the U.S.
2. Detailed analysis on housing cost and its burden for the U.S households.
3. Examination on house price market and insights into the correlation with households' incomes in the U.S.


# Methods of Advanced Data Engineering Project

This repo contains an open data project, which has a structure based on a template provided by MADE module at FAU. [Template](https://github.com/jvalue/made-template)

This repository contains (a) a data science project that is developed by **me** over the course of the semester, and (b) the exercises that are submitted over the course of the semester.

Before you begin, make sure you have Python and Jayvee installed.

**To get started**, please follow these steps:
1. Copy the repository link from the green "Code" button (HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI).
2. Clone it to your local machine using: [git clone](https://github.com/xxhensila/made-template.git)
3. Open a terminal and move into the cloned directory in you pc.
4. Install dependencies.
5. Run the project.


#### (Optional) üåü Give a Star!

1. If you like this project, please ‚≠ê it to show your support!

2. Give the [Jayvee project](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee) a GitHub star. ‚≠ê


## Project Work
All project work submissions are placed in the `project` folder.

### Exporting a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebooks can be exported using `nbconvert` (`pip install nbconvert`). For example, to export the example notebook to HTML: `jupyter nbconvert --to html examples/final-report-example.ipynb --embed-images --output final-report.html`


## Exercises
The exercises are completed using [Jayvee](https://github.com/jvalue/jayvee). You **can** view submissions in the `exercises` folder in this repository named according to their number from one to five: `exercise<number from 1-5>.jv`.

In regular intervals, exercises will be given as homework to complete during the semester. Details and deadlines will be discussed in the lecture, also see the [course schedule](https://made.uni1.de/).

### Exercise Feedback
MADE module offers automated exercise feedback using a GitHub action (that is defined in `.github/workflows/exercise-feedback.yml`). 

To view the exercise feedback, navigate to Actions ‚Üí Exercise Feedback in this repository.

The exercise feedback is executed whenever you make a change in files in the `exercise` folder and push your local changes to the repository on GitHub. To see the feedback, open the latest GitHub Action run, open the `exercise-feedback` job and `Exercise Feedback` step. You should see command line output that contains output like this:

```sh
Found exercises/exercise1.jv, executing model...
Found output file airports.sqlite, grading...
